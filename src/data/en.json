His grandfather was Tamai Kingoro who had a coal cargo handling business in Kitakyusyu City - Fukuoka, Japan, and was the central character of one of Hino‚Äôs novels, ‚ÄúThe Flowers and the Dragon.‚Äù Nakamura studied at Seinan Gakuin junior high school, Fukuoka high school and after graduating from Kyusyu University School of Medicine, he worked at the National Hizen Clinic (now called Hizen Psychiatric Center) in neighboring Saga prefecture. He also worked at hospitals based in Fukuoka. During this time, he joined a mountain climbing group that walked through the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, the beginning of his affinity for these countries.",
      "doctorTitle": "From Doctor to Humanitarian",
      "doctorDesc": "He was appointed as a doctor for a Christian religious group attending to leprosy patients in Peshawar, northwest Pakistan. A year before, the NGO group Peshawar-Kai was founded to support Dr. Nakamura‚Äôs work. He recalls those days about the medical tools as follows; ‚Äúone trolley car that falls down when we push, a few twisted tweezers and a stethoscope that injures you when put into the ear.‚Äù He even carried the patients on his back. Witnessing the suffering firsthand, he expanded his efforts to address water, food, and infrastructure, believing that health begins with access to basic needs.",
      "pmsTitle": "Peace Japan Medical Services",
      "pmsDesc": "As the head of Peace Japan Medical Services (PMS), also known as Peshawar-kai, Nakamura oversaw the building of clinics, mosques, and water infrastructure in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

      "canalTitle": "Turning Deserts into Farmland",
      "canalDesc": " A devastating drought occurred in Afghanistan. Farmlands gradually turned into desert and the people abandoned their villages one after another. Children were the largest victims of hunger and thirst. ‚ÄúIt is no longer a matter of healing diseases,‚Äù he declared. So convinced, he decided to start an irrigation project and began to dig wells. By 2006, the number of wells had grown to 1600. 2001. In response to extreme droughts, Dr. Nakamura led the creation of a 27-kilometer irrigation canal from the Kunar River, reviving Gamberi Desert into farmland and a vibrant green valley. His engineering work helped support over 650,000 people and turned the once-barren area into a source of life.",
      "irrigationTitle": "Begins Construction of the Irrigation Canal",
      "irrigationDesc": "As they continued to dig wells they were faced with the depletion of groundwater.

It is resistant to dry weather and is the main ingredient in heroin and opium. ‚ÄúThere will be no restoration of Afghanistan without a recovery of farm villages,‚Äù he said. Realizing the limit of irrigation relying on groundwater, he started to build the irrigation canal.",
      "marwaridTitle": "Completion of the Marwarid Irrigation Canal",
      "marwaridDesc": "Construction for an irrigation canal named ‚ÄúMarwarid,‚Äù meaning pearl in Persian, was completed. Not only the desolated farmland but also places where it used to be desert were reborn into green lands.

Due to the irrigation canal that he had constructed, 16,500 hectares of land were watered. It covers an area approximately half the size of Fukuoka city. It was the result of donations from all over Japan to Peshawar-kai and the effort of both the Afghan people and Japanese staff who supported the project.",
      "deathTitle": "Final Days & Global Mourning",

This transformed local economies and food supply across rural Afghanistan.The irrigation system reached even the most isolated areas, such as Goryak village, turning once-dry fields into fertile farmland. Despite repeated flash floods, PMS rebuilt intake systems and canals on both banks of the Kunar River, restoring life to areas abandoned by previous development efforts.",

The Gamberi Desert itself was transformed, turning barren land into green fields and fruit orchards.",
  "canalDesc1": " After the Soviet withdrawal, he entered Afghanistan for the first time in 1991 and saw Nangarhar ‚Äî tired from war, poverty, and drought. That year, he built three clinics for war-displaced people in Nangarhar. But soon, he realized the real illness was something else: drought and malnutrition. With the slogan ‚ÄúWater, not weapons,‚Äùhe began constructing irrigation canals that turned barren lands into productive farmland. In 2003, Nakamura built an irrigation canal in Khiywa District, Nangarhar, which people named ‚ÄúThe Pearl.‚Äù This 25-kilometer-long canal carries water from the Kunar River to farmlands and homes.",
